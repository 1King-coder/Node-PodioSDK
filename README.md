# Node PodioAPI SDK

This package is a voluntary work to make life easier when developing automations and integrations
for Podio Applications.

The authentication method supported for now is username and password. The others will be implemented
soon.

Check https://developers.podio.com/doc for more information about the API methods.

This package still in development and is far from finishing (don't know if it will finish 1 day).

That package is a personal initiative to make my life easier when developing automations and integrations
for my actual job at a Academic initiative (Junior enterprise) where we use Podio a lot and I couldn't make
any of the sdk work properly (except the php and ruby one) so I've decided to develop this one.

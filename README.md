# Experimental TS-Node PodioAPI SDK

This package is a voluntary work to make life easier when developing automations and integrations
for Podio Applications.

The authentication method supported for now is username and password. The others will be implemented
soon.

Check https://developers.podio.com/doc for more information about the API methods.

As this still in development, there is only a testing repository, soon the package development
will be moved to other github repository dedicated to it and turn it into a open source package.

Feel free to create a fork and add features in a new-feature-branch and contact me to review the pull request.

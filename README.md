# Podio Node Client Library (SDK)

## _This is a non-official package_

- npm package link: https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-podio-api-sdk

This package is a voluntary work to make life easier when developing automations and integrations
for Podio Applications.

The authentication method supported for now is username and password. The others will be implemented
soon.

Check https://developers.podio.com/doc for more information about the API methods.

This package still in development and is far from finishing.

To install the package run: `npm i node-podio-api-sdk`

For those who want to help the development of this tool:

- Fork it
- Create a new branch with the name of your feature `git checkout -b new-feature-name`
- Test it
- Commit your changes
- Push your commits to the branch
- Create a pull request and await for me or other maintener make the review

That package is a personal initiative to make my life easier when developing automations and integrations
for my actual job at a Academic initiative (Junior enterprise) where we use Podio a lot and I couldn't make
any of the sdk work properly (except the php and ruby one) so I've decided to develop this one.
